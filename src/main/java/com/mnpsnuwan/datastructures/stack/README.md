# Stack
A stack is a one-ended linear data structure which models a real world stack by having two primary operations, namely ***push*** and ***pop***.
**FILO** - First In Last Out

**When and where is a Stack used?**
1. Used by undo mechanisms in text editors.
2. Used in compiler syntax checking for matching brackets and braces.
3. Can be used to model a pile of books or plates.
4. Used behind the scenes to support recursion by keeping track of previous function calls.
5. Can be used to do a Depth First Search (DEF) on a graph.

### Complexity

| Operation        | Stack |
|------------------|-------|
| Push             | O(1)  |
| Pop              | O(1)  |
| Peek             | O(1)  |
| Search           | O(n)  |
| Size             | O(1)  |
