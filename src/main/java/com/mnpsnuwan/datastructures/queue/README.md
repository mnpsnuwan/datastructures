3. Web server request management where you want first come first served.
4. Breadth First Search (BFS) graph traversal.

### Complexity

| Operation | Queue |
|-----------|-------|
| Enqueue   | O(1)  |
| Dequeue   | O(1)  |
| Peek      | O(1)  |
| Search    | O(n)  |
| Remove    | O(n)  |
| IsEmpty   | O(1)  |
